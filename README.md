# Menu
This is a simple mini-project that is designed using HTML5, CSS, and Vanilla Javascript.
You can find the files by identifying their domain.
This project displays a card containing the details of some people that I have stored in my local database (reviews[] in Menu.js).
I will try to improve this code in the near future when I have completed my course in Database Managemnet Systems.
